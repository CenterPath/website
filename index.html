  <h3>DevOps challenges are a major distraction.</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Deployment times slow to a crawl as your teams focus their energies on adding new features.</li>

    <li>More and more bugs make it through flaky test suites leaving customers with a terrible experience of your product.</li>

    <li>Your engineers seem to be stuck in firefighting mode while a backlog of unfinished improvement projects pile up.</li>

    <li>Engineers move on in their careers leaving behind homegrown solutions without any documentation.</li>
  </ul>
